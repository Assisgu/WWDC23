I am Gustavo, I am 24 years old, and I am part of the Apple Developer Academy team in Brazil, at Senac in SÃ£o Paulo. In my free time, I enjoy studying and learning new things, as well as exercising my body with physical activities such as skateboarding, going to the gym, and swimming.

My contact with technology was a matter of overcoming obstacles. When I was younger, I took an electronics technical course, where I had my first contact with programming, but in low-level language such as Assembly. It was a bit frustrating because I couldn't understand it, even though I tried hard. However, later on, I discovered that programming is not limited to Assembly and that there are other programming languages that are easier to understand.

So, I started studying internet systems at college, where I had the opportunity to become part of the Apple Developer Academy.
