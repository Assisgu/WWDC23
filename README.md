When I turned 7 I got a Simon game as a gift. It's a memorization sequence game and a lot of fun. My grandfather loved spending the afternoons playing with me, and when we weren't playing he would play the guitar. So my proposal was to bring together these memories I have from my childhood, and build an app with the things my grandfather loved to spend his time with. This is how Toim was created, a game to exercise our memory with the sound of some guitar notes.
