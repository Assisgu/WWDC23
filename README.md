# Toim - Memory Game with Guitar Notes
Toim is a memory game inspired by my childhood memories and the things my grandfather loved. When I was 7 years old, I received a Simon game as a gift, which was a lot of fun to play. My grandfather and I would spend afternoons playing Simon together, and when we weren't playing, he would strum his guitar.

Toim combines these nostalgic elements into a single app experience. Players are challenged to memorize sequences of guitar notes and repeat them back in the correct order. It's not only a test of memory but also a tribute to the moments spent with my grandfather.
